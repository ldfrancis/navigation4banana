# navigation4banana [udacity-DRLND]
## Project Details
This is the first project in the deep reinforcement learning nanodegree on udacity. It involves training an agent to navigate a world littered with bananas and collect as many good bananas as possible while avoiding the bad bananas. The good bananas are yellow while the bad ones are blue.
A reward of +1 is given to the agent for each yellow banana collected and -1 for each blue banana.
The state space is a 37 dimension vector whose values describe agent's velocity and objects in front of the agent, and It is continous with values in the range [0,1]. The action space is descrete
